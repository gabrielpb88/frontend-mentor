## My process

### Built with

- CSS variables
- Flexbox
- CSS Position
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The usage of CSS `position` attribute with `absolute` or `relative` values to position or to display based on states like `active`, `hover` or any other.


### Continued development

I intend to keep practicing the usage of CSS variables, positions and classes naming.

### Useful resources
