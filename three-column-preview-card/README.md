## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile First 
- React
- Styled-components
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- It was a good opportunity to practice using style-components and mobile-first.
- I learned that react-app-env.d.ts file is the responsible to enable import of svg files using create-react-app and react-scripts. 
- GlobalStyles to reset the css.

### Continued development

Now, take more complex layouts to use style-components and practice Components with react.
