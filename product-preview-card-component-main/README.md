## My process

### Time
- Estimated: 4 hours
- Taken: 6 hours

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive

### What I learned

- Media queries to implement the responsive behavior.
- I used an ```img``` tag at the beginning but don't know why I changed to use a ```div``` with background (Not a good idea)
- Because I used a background image in a div I had to take of attributes like no-repeat, position, etc

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing in responsive layouts, flexbox and more other approaches for the solutions.
