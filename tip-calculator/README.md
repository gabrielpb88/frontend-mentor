## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

First time using SCSS. I think it is very usefull by allowing to write SCSS almost like json objects.
Validation without any lib is very boring and it is easy to make mistakes.

### Continued development

Probably I am going to start using some lib or frontend framework as react or angular to build components and use validation libraries to validate fields.
